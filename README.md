# Arya: fastn Font Package

This repository contains a [fastn font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Arya](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arya/about).

Arya is a Devanagari and Latin type family. It originated with Modular
InfoTech's 1201, and was made more smooth. The new and original Latin design is
intended to match the Devanagari in weight and and size with an unusual
high-contrast sans serif design.

Designers: Eduardo Tunni, Principal design
